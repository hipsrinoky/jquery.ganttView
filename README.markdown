jQuery.ganttView
================

The jQuery.ganttView plugin is a very lightweight plugin for creating a Gantt chart in plain HTML...no vector graphics or images required.  The plugin supports dragging and resizing the Gantt blocks and callbacks to trap the updated data.
Original repository https://github.com/thegrubbsian/jquery.ganttView by thegrubbsian.

It supported jQuery 1.9 || 2.0 or higher. and date.js replaced to moment.js.

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
Currently the plugin has been tested, and is working in: FF 3.5+, Chrome 5+, Safari 4+, IE8+.  There are minor issues in IE7 and I haven't even attempted to use it in IE6.  If you encounter any issues with any version of Internet Explorer and would like to contribute CSS fixes please do so, several people have asked for IE6 support.


Dependencies
------------
The plugin depends on the following libraries:

- jQuery 1.9, 2.0 or higher (obviously)
- jQuery-UI 1.8 or higher
- moment.js
